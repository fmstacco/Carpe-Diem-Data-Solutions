    <div class="success-case1">
      <h3 class="success-case-headline">Stock Control</h3>
        <p class="sucess-case-text">Carpe Diem Data Solutions were critical to implementing an efficient inventory management system and improving product availability to our customers. We had a big problem of lack of stock in stores. We have a large number of items and through <strong><em>data analysis and statistical models</em></strong> we have been able to prevent disruption to supply, improve our customer service, profitability and market share.</p>

        <div class="success-case2">
          <h3 class="success-case-headline">Sales Forecasting</h3>
            <p class="sucess-case-text">When we found Carpe Diem Data Solutions we had a huge challenge with the lack of accuracy in sales forecast. We had poor quality of our data because salespeople did not see this as an important task. So we employ a <strong><em>data strategy,</em></strong> including salespeople and equipping them and now they see the strategic value of the data. Our accuracy in the forecast of sales improved by 50%. Thanks Carpe Diem!</p>
            <p><em>Francis, Gigabyte Supermarkets</em></p>

              <div class="success-case3">
                <h3 class="success-case-headline">Customer Services</h3>
                  <p class="sucess-case-text">Hiring Carpe Diem was the right decision to leverage the <strong><em>profitability</em></strong> of our company. We had a lot of customers, however our profit margin was still below expected. So by analyzing our data we understood that we needed to reduce the set of non -profitable customers, so they should buy via distributors. And so we are concentrating our resources on the right customers and we improved our profitability by 20%.</p>
